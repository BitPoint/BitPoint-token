# The BitPoint 

BitPoint-token dApp 29st May 2017

### OVERVIEW

BitPointX is a dApp that allows users to invest in the bitpoint by providing liquidity to our ATM Network. The dApp issues tokens on receipt of ethereum, these tokens are essentially smart bonds whose value is pegged to the Euro. When a user buys BitPoint Tokens(BPT), the ethereum is sent to a account on an exchange where they are immediately turned into euros, this is done to manage volatility. When a customer orders cryptocurrency from the ATM, 98% of the order is sent to there wallet in the currency of their choice. This cash is sent back to the exchange for reuse. The remaining 2% (the profit) is used to purchase ether which is sent to the dApp where it is used to mint more tokens and devided proportionally to existing token holders. When a token holder wished to redeeem their tokens, ethereum is purchaced and sent to there address. The tokens are then burnt
